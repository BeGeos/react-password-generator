## Password Generator using ReactJS

A simple password generator with some cool styling and background. Inspired by nature and **100daysofCoding**
This is the first project using ReactJS. Main components include:

- Form - to compile the complexity of the password√π
- Trivia - A simple popup for some information about passwords and password security
- BoxConteiner - The main box for all the elements
- Password - The container for the randomly generated password

All together a simple but fun project. Security is important and sometimes complying with websites' guidelines for passwords is not easy.
A random generator keeps this problem at bay and it increases security and awareness.

It gets quite difficult to remember though. this is why I have also created another full stack [project](https://github.com/BeGeos/full-stack-password-manager) to manage passwords. It is well-suited for any occasion and I think It came out pretty awesome.
